## Website builer
A simple website builder that allows you to create content on the page. Simply drag and drop the chosen element (such as a container, text, or even a payment form) onto the editor page.

The editor has full accessibility; for example, to undo your last actions, click the Undo button or press the Ctrl + Z key combination.

To preview the site in Preview mode, press the Ctrl + P key combination

To style the selected element, choose the section in the Settings tab and modify the styles as desired. Hotkeys are also available, for example, Ctrl + B to make text bold or Ctrl + I to italicize font style.

You can see the layers of your entire page. To do that just navigate to the Layers tab where you can see your layers structure in a tree-like representation.

## Kanban Board
You can create new lanes and new tickets within them. It's possible to drag cards and lanes to change their order. You can create new tags and assign other users who have access to your team to specific tickets, as well as leave a contact link.

## Team Access
If you've created an agency, you can create sub-accounts for that agency.

To grant access to another user for a sub-account of the agency, you can send them an invitation via email.

If the user accepts the invitation to the agency, you can control their access to different sub-accounts.
